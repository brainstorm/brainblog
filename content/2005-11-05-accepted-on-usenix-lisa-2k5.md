Yesss ! After writing a pretty long email explaining my interests, projects, work, etc... Me and my colleague Xavier, have received an email from Tara Mulligan, Scholastic Programs Manager:

> Hello Roman,
> 
> The USENIX Association is pleased to offer you a stipend grant of US $(sum of money) to help you attend the 19th USENIX Large Installation System Administration Conference, (LISA '05), which will be held in San Diego, CA, December 4-9, 2005. We are very hopeful that this grant will allow you to attend.  
> (...) 

You can check [LISA's main page][1] and see their juicy tutorial and technical sessions [program][2].

Some of my friends told me to go to an annual [22C3][3] meeting, from Chaos Computer Club, which has nothing to do with [CCC][4] nor [CCC][5]. I've had to drop their offer because I was waiting the above mail from LISA... So, you guys, beat that GMT-8 vs your not\_too\_much\_far\_from_home GMT+1 ;-P

Now seriously, enjoy you all too and have a nice Christmas from Berlin ;) I'll be preparing my final exams that time :_/
