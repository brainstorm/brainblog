If you ever happen to need GPRS "MoBoffice" data connection in India with [Airtel.in][2], keep in mind that after activating your pre-paid SIM-card you should:

1.  Send an SMS message to **170** with text **PLIVE**
2.  Dial ***148#** (toll free).
3.  You will be presented a menu with 2 options: select 1, to activate Airtel Moboffice.
4.  After 1 hour you'll receive nearly 6 SMS's with details on howto configure your mobile.
5.  If you use a nokia770, make sure that the GPRS access point is **airtelgprs.com** and **\*not\*** **airtelfun.com**. Nokia 770 hacker edition has this outdated info by default and will not work out of the box :/

Airtel.in website is hugely undocumented on this aspect, I discovered this details (tricks?) by sending an email to Airtel.in support: 121@airtelindia.com :S

And btw, the tariff at the moment is **30 paisa** for each **50KB** you use... 100 paisa is 1 rupee, so to check your email and post a text entry on your blog costs you about 1 to 2 rupees... really cheap indeed !
