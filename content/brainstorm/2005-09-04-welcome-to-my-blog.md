title: Welcome to my blog !
---

So here it is: yet another personal geekish blog :) You may be asking... why another one ? Well, I've some thoughts, projects, wishes... *interests* for short, which I'm really willing to share for too much time till now.

My main purposes on this blog are manifold: technical writings, thoughts, findings, reflections... and of course being interesting and fun altogether. Moreover, I hope you would enjoy it like I will ! Please, feel free to post comments ! :) 

In addition, I decided that posts will be indifferently written in English, Catalan or even Spanish because I don't want to stuck on my way of expressing in just one language and because I enjoy using them all.

Last but not least I want to thank the people who helped/advised me and I learnt from while deciding to start my blog: [pof][1], [jmmv][2], [pancake][3] & [3des][4].
