title: Cross-compiling binaries for multiple architectures with Docker

## Cross compiling toolchains today

When embarquing into **embedded systems development** to [fix relatively old hardware][repair_drone], a need becomes clear fairly early: recompiling software
on an embedded system becomes a **daunting task** due to too old base system or simply **irritatingly slow to iterate**.

That is why distributions such as Debian really shine with their [support and commitment for multiple architectures][debian_architectures]. So all is fun and happy development until someone reaches out to the documentation on how to [setup a cross-compiling toolchain][linaro_xcompile].

But wait, there's [crosstool-ng][crosstool-ng], seems to be a wrapper that could help me cross-build my binaries... 

```
$ ct-ng armv5-linux-gnueabi
make: *** No rule to make target `armv5-linux-gnueabi'.  Stop.
$ ct-ng armv6-rpi-linux-gnueabi
  LN    config
  MKDIR config.gen
  IN    config.gen/arch.in
  IN    config.gen/kernel.in
  IN    config.gen/cc.in
  IN    config.gen/binutils.in
  IN    config.gen/libc.in
  IN    config.gen/debug.in
  CONF  config/config.in
#
# configuration written to .config

Toolchain for the Raspberry Pi, with hard-float.

```

So that is [hard-float][hard-float] raspberry pi support by default, which will give me an `Invalid Instruction` exception so I should activate `CT_ARCH_FLOAT_SW`
in the `.config` and then... **sigh**.

## Cross compiling toolchains with DockCross

  Enter [dockcross][dockcross] where after [a small pullrequest][dockcross_thewtex] to support [ARMv5][arm7] with no hard-float support and **installing the dockcross tool once**:
  
```
$ docker run thewtex/cross-compiler-linux-armv5 > ~/bin/dockcross
$ chmod +x ~/bin/dockcross
```
  
  Cross-compiling for your [drone][repair_drone], your [favorite reverse engineering framework][radare_xcompile] or your [shader-based RetroPie frontend][TurboLoader] is just two commands away:
  
```
$ dockcross --image thewtex/cross-compiler-linux-armv5 ./configure --with-compiler=armel --host=armel
$ dockcross make
```

  For an extra icing in the cake, it is worth mentioning that [DockCross][dockcross] also supports **QEMU emulation** that **can be used in the same container**, right after your binaries are built.
  
  Furthermore, for the cherry in the cake, have a look at [TravisCI running QEMU for ARM][travisci-arm], unbelievable.
  
  Happy hacking and x-compiling!
  
## QEMUlating SDL/OpenGL inside Docker for Mac?

Using [Nut][nut-devel] to **spawn containers with X11 support**:

```
$ cat nut.yml
syntax_version: "6"
project_name: TurboLoader
macros:
  run:
    usage: xcompile and qemu TurboLoader in a docker container
    docker_image: aretroui
    privileged: true
    enable_gui: true
    security_opts:
    - seccomp=unconfined
```

While [other apps such as Chrome work well][docker-on-desktop], **raw OpenGL shader support is [unfortunately not there yet in Docker's HyperKit][hyperkit_gpu] under OSX** (hint: use native Linux instead for now with [nvidia-docker][nvidia-docker]):

```
$ nut run
** Test project **
多多 Smoke test Lua ??
