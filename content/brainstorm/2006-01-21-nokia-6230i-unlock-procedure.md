title: Nokia 6230i unlock procedure
---

I've recently acquired a nokia 6230i cellphone but it's locked for my provider: amena... but hey, good news, I can [unlock it for free][1] :) The reason of this post is twofold:

*   Give thanks to [3DES][2] for his short but informative [post][3] about that matter ;) 
*   The procedure required to unlock nokia 6230i [differs][4] from what's advised on the web: **you have to keep your SIM inserted** on the phone while executing the procedure, **do not remove it beforehand !**

Just wanted to document that issue that kept me trying and reading recipes for a while.
