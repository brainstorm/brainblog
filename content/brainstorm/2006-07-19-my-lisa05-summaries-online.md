title: My LISA'05 summaries online
---

By accident I've found my past [summarized conferences][1]... I've never been notified that they were actually published on [;login: magazine][2] :-!

I've [already posted][3] about them, but here is a quick reference if you're interested:

*   Integration of MacOS X devices into a Centrally Managed UNIX environment
*   Herding Cats: Managing a Mobile UNIX Platform
*   Regcoll: Centralized registry framework for infrastructure system management
*   GULP: Grand Unified Logging Project
*   Toward an Automated Vulnerability Comparison of Open Source IMAP Servers
*   Fast User-Mode rootkit scanner for the enterprise
