title: Sun Microsystems Campus Ambassador
---

<a id="p97" rel="attachment" class="imagelink" href="http://blogs.nopcode.org/brainstorm/2007/12/04/sun-microsystems-campus-ambassador/sun-microsystems-logo/" title="Sun microsystems logo" align=right><img id="image97" src="http://blogs.nopcode.org/brainstorm/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/sun.thumbnail.png" alt="Sun microsystems logo"  align='right' /></a>

As the title states, I've been recently elected as a campus ambassador for my university. When I talk about my newly acquired job, people keep asking: Woah, nice... hummm, but what does it mean after all ? Here are my main responsabilities on this cool project:

*   Lead the Sun developer community on your campus by starting a Sun Open Source User Group
*   Run Sun Technology demo sessions as part of your user group meetings
*   Help support Sun events and contests
*   Evangelize Sun development tools to students, professors and researchers

So I'll be posting here (or my own sun.com blog) my experiences on this new opportunity on my life as a computer enthusiast :) There are a lot of new and amazing **Open Source** Sun initiatives to discover and explore, I'll try to keep you all readers entertained with my findings !

In fact, [jmmv][1] has already greeted my on his blog in advance about a topic related to [DTrace][2], thanks Julipedia ;) 

Thanks also to my [favourite sysadmins][3] for my new DTrace [privileges][4] needed to conduct my first tech talk :)
