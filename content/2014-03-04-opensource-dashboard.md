title: 'My take on the ELK stack: best opensource dashboard'

A dashboard with pretty plots and numbers about your organization... **It shouldn't be that difficult, right**?

Luckily, ElasticSearch+Logstash+Kibana did came up with a nice stack to solve this problem. Here's my result and **how I solved some integration hiccups**. The resulting beta dashboard, as it is now, looks like this:

[<img src="https://blogs.nopcode.org/brainstorm/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/dataspace_blurred-300x163.png" alt="DataSpace beta operations panel" width="300" height="163" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-842" />][1]

[Many][2] [many][3] [many][4] [other][5] [blog][6] [posts][7] have addressed this issue, but I would like to share a couple of tweaks I came up with while working on it.

<!--more-->

## Logstash and iRODs custom log parsing

Broadly speaking, I found the following issues when setting up the dashboard:

1.  [Index design:][8] Logstash default index formatting (logstash-YYYYMMDD) [**brought down a 30GB RAM machine**][9] (line 63).
2.  **Missing year** in log timestamps from logs content, **getting it from log filenames** (lines 31 to 42 below).
3.  [GeoIP coordinates][10] not being parsed by Kibana's bettermap (lines 44 to 58).

## ElasticSearch tweaks

As mentioned, the default **"daily" indexing scheme in logstash did not work** for my purposes. When monitoring elasticsearch with the [head plugin][11], the status went red while ingesting events from logs. Thanks to [@zackarytong][12] and other's feedback, I managed to address the issue:

Then, **Kibana could not connect to the elasticsearch** backend when large time ranges were defined. After some chrome developer tool and CURLing, I reported [the issue][13], **too many indexes were URL-encoded** which required to setup the following ElasticSearch directive:

<pre>http.max_initial_line_length: 64kb</pre>

In the future, I might consider **further indexing optimizations** by using the [ElasticSearch index curator tool][14] to optimize and cut down index usage, but for now I want to keep all data accessible from the dashboard.

## Kibana

The presentation side of this **dashboard hipster stack also had some gimmicks**. My original idea of showing three separate Kibana bettermaps, one per AWS region, had to wait after [another issue got addressed very recently][15]. Both Chrome developer console and [AngularJS batarang][16] were very useful to find issues in Kibana and its interactions with the ElasticSearch backend.

Speaking of Amazon and their regions, while AWS has exposed a great amount of functionality through their developer APIs, **at the time of writing these lines there are missing API endpoints**, such as billing information in all regions (only available in **us-east-1**), and **fetching remaining credits** from your [EDU Amazon grant][17], should you have one. **The only viable option left today is scraping it**:

If one wants to keep track of AWS expenses on ES, some specific [index type mappings][18] changes on the ElasticSearch side are needed:

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">curl -XPUT 'https://ids-panel.incf.net:9200/aws-2014.02/credits/_mapping' -d '{
  "aws_credit_balance": {
    "properties": {
      "aws_credit_balance": {
        "type": "integer"
      }
    }
  }
}'
</pre>

In a more large scale/business setting, [Netflix's Ice][19] could be definitely a good fit.

## Conclusions and future improvements

It has been a fun project to **collect data about your organization's services and be able to expose it as clearly as possible and in realtime**, feels like I would like to do this for a living as a consultant some day. Some **new insight coming from the dashboard** has allowed us to decide on downscale resources, **ultimately saving money**.

**The feedback from INCF people has been invaluable to rethink how some data is presented** and what it all means, always bring third parties and ask them their opinions. **Visualization is hard to get right, bring in users and consider their feedback**.

My next iteration in this project is to **have finer detail on which activities users are performing** (data being shared, copied, downloaded). This could be leveraged with some custom [iRODS microservices for ElasticSearch][20] or evaluating other EU-funded projects in the topic such as [Chesire3][21].

When it comes to who can access the dashboard, there's a recent [blog post on multi-faceted authentication][22], a.k.a **showing different views of the dashboard to different audiences**. I've already tried [Kibana's authentication proxy][23], which supports OAuth among other auth systems, but there are a few rough edges to polish.

On the logstash backend, **it might be worth grepping iRODS codebase for log stanzas** to assess **important log events worth parsing** and getting good semantic tokens out of them. Luckily, ElasticSearch is backed by [Lucene's][24] **full text engine helps a lot** in not having to do this tedious task. **Kibana/ElasticSearch search and filtering are excellent**.

Last but not least, some remaining issues leading to total world domination include:

1.  Instrumenting all your organization's Python code with [Logbook sinking to a Redis exchange.][25]
2.  **Easily add/include other types of panels in Kibana**, perhaps allowing better or more explicit integration possibilities for D3, [mpld3][26] or [BokehJS][27] with Kibana.
3.  [Getting UNIQ count for records in ElasticSearch][28] (i.e, count unique number of IPs, users, etc...) which are on the roadmap under [aggregations][29], so they are coming soon :)
